University group assignment for CSCI222 (Systems Development).

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project involves the design and implementation of a file management/archiving system. The system allows users to store changes to files for later retrieval while remaining efficient in terms of storage requirements and processing speed. This system aimed to be a solution for arbitrarily large binary files, which is currently (and efficiently) solved by most popular source code control versioning systems such as Git.
<br />
<br />
The programâ€™s main functionalities are storing and managing files in persistent storage, compression/decompression of these files, keeping track of additions and removals (i.e. version control), managed via an intuitive graphical user interface. The project uses a MySQL database as its backbone for data storage.
<br />
<br />
All code and documentation is available within this repository.
